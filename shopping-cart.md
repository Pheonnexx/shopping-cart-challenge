# Shopping Cart Checkout

## Problem Description
---

In our quest to stay in touch with what's going on in the commercial
world we've decided to open a supermarket - we sell only three
products:

|Product code | Name         | Price |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
|FR1          | Fruit tea    |  £3.11|
|SR1          | Strawberries |  £5.00|
|CF1          | Coffee       | £11.23|

Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers and of fruit tea.
She wants us to add a rule to do this.

The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries
to get a price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more
strawberries, the price should drop to £4.50 each.

Our checkout can scan items in any order, and because the CEO and COO
change their minds often, it needs to be flexible regarding our
pricing rules.


## Task
---
- Your goal is to implement a checkout so that it will scan items in and
calculate total prices correctly for any combination of the products and offers above.
