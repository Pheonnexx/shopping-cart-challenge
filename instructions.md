## About the interview

This challenge and solution will form part of your face to face interview in the format of a peer review. We will ask questions about the solution, your approach, etc.

- iterate from a rough solution towards a refined one
- verify or test your work
- write clean/idiomatic code
- articulate tradeoffs in your solution and the consequences of those
